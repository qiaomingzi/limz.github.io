My subscription was extended by 60 days to give me enough time to find another service. I&amp;rsquo;ve used it for a couple of years and have been quite happy with it, except maybe for the micro stuttering I experienced. It had the possibility to back up to a local external drive as well as online (offsite) with plenty of configurable options.</description></item><item><title>Micro Stuttering Caused by CrashPlan</title><link>https://www.henriksommerfeld.se/micro-stuttering-caused-by-crashplan/</link><pubDate>Mon, 20 Mar 2017 06:50:51 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.henriksommerfeld.se/micro-stuttering-caused-by-crashplan/</guid><description>For some time I have tried to figure out what&amp;rsquo;s been causing the micro stuttering I&amp;rsquo;ve experienced on my Windows 10 machine. Under moderate load applications have stopped responding for short periods of time, most obvious is audio playback where an unpleasant sound has interrupted playback. I could not see any correlation between this behaviour and a specific application, high CPU, disk or memory utilisation.
My machine is a desktop computer I have built myself from parts, so I thought I might have made some bad decision regarding hardware compatibility.</description></item></channel></rss>
