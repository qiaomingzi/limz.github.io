In the current solution, everything but the CSS is common, even the HTML. That has proven to lack the necessary flexibility when the different subsidiaries have different needs and their design agencies are told that they are not allowed change the mark-up. Every change also has to be approved by all three subsidiaries, which takes time.</description></item><item><title>Easier Debugging of JS tests in Visual Studio with Chutzpah 4.3.0+</title><link>https://www.henriksommerfeld.se/easier-debugging-of-js-tests-in-visual-studio-with-chutzpah-4-3-0/</link><pubDate>Fri, 09 Dec 2016 14:29:49 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.henriksommerfeld.se/easier-debugging-of-js-tests-in-visual-studio-with-chutzpah-4-3-0/</guid><description>If you have a Visual Studio project that uses Chutzpah for JavaScript tests, things recently got a lot easier with a long-awaited update.
Problem When all tests pass with the Chutzpah test runner everything is fine, but when you need to debug a test, things haven&amp;rsquo;t been as easy. Debugging the JS code in Visual Studio is something I never got working and never really cared about anyway. The best debugging tool for JavaScript is of course the web browser, but when selecting Open in browser in Visual Studio, Chutzpah has served the HTML test page (Jasmine in my case) through the FILE:/// protocol.</description></item><item><title>A beginner’s experiences of unit testing Javascript</title><link>https://www.henriksommerfeld.se/a-beginners-experiences-of-unit-testing-javascript/</link><pubDate>Sun, 07 Apr 2013 21:41:14 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.henriksommerfeld.se/a-beginners-experiences-of-unit-testing-javascript/</guid><description>As someone working mostly with SharePoint server-side code, unit tests are something that requires quite some investment in time to get rolling with – and consequently not being done. Javascript is a different thing though. Since a big part of most projects using SharePoint is (or should be) done with Javascript, we should be testing that code. (Of course this applies to any system with a web interface, but I assume most of you that don’t have SharePoint in your CV’s are already doing this).</description></item></channel></rss>
