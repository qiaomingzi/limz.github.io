My subscription was extended by 60 days to give me enough time to find another service. I&amp;rsquo;ve used it for a couple of years and have been quite happy with it, except maybe for the micro stuttering I experienced. It had the possibility to back up to a local external drive as well as online (offsite) with plenty of configurable options.</description></item></channel></rss>
