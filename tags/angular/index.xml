This makes it quick to determine if a problem exists in the Angular app or in the REST service we&amp;rsquo;re calling (that we develop alongside the Angular app). Since logging it this way will show exactly which method is being called, the data being sent, headers and everything you need, there is no risk of mistaking one server interaction with another one.</description></item><item><title>Code Sharing with Multi-App Angular Project Using Base Components</title><link>https://www.henriksommerfeld.se/code-sharing-with-multi-app-angular-project-using-base-components/</link><pubDate>Sat, 18 Nov 2017 11:51:22 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://www.henriksommerfeld.se/code-sharing-with-multi-app-angular-project-using-base-components/</guid><description>I&amp;rsquo;m building a new version of a web shop in Angular that should be used on three different web sites for three of my client&amp;rsquo;s subsidiary companies. In the current solution, everything but the CSS is common, even the HTML. That has proven to lack the necessary flexibility when the different subsidiaries have different needs and their design agencies are told that they are not allowed change the mark-up. Every change also has to be approved by all three subsidiaries, which takes time.</description></item></channel></rss>
