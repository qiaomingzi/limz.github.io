I‚Äôll talk about my criteria, pros and cons.
This was a personal website made for a non-technical person (why I needed a CMS at all in the first place) who associates websites with WordPress. She, my wife, is fairly tech savvy, but wouldn‚Äôt accept editing markdown or other ‚Äúcomplicated things‚Äù üôÉ My hypothesis was that I could somewhat compensate for unintuitive features with some ‚Äúon-site training‚Äù.</description></item><item><title>Netlify CMS - Incorrectly eaten value</title><link>https://www.henriksommerfeld.se/netlify-cms-incorrectly-eaten-value/</link><pubDate>Tue, 10 Sep 2019 07:36:10 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://www.henriksommerfeld.se/netlify-cms-incorrectly-eaten-value/</guid><description>I&amp;rsquo;m writing this in case I forget it later.
Context I&amp;rsquo;m migrating my wife&amp;rsquo;s blog from WordPress to GatsbyJS and since she&amp;rsquo;s not comfortable with Markdown or Git, I need a CMS. I aim at a zero-cost solution and I want the content to be part of the repository, rather than a separate thing (like what an API driven CMS provides).
Problem Netlify CMS crashes when the frontmatter is followed by a newline and an image.</description></item></channel></rss>
