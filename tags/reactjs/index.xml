All CSS is written from scratch for both sites, no framework. They both have categories and tags that you can use to find related posts. No server-side API is used, so once the build is done, everything is static. Well, I use Google Analytics and Disqus on both sites, but those are third-party API&amp;rsquo;s that I don&amp;rsquo;t have to manage.</description></item><item><title>Netlify CMS with Gatsby - Best Option with Some Quirks</title><link>https://www.henriksommerfeld.se/netlify-cms/</link><pubDate>Fri, 22 Nov 2019 00:02:10 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://www.henriksommerfeld.se/netlify-cms/</guid><description>When I needed a CMS for a Gatsby site, my choice became Netlify CMS. I‚Äôll talk about my criteria, pros and cons.
This was a personal website made for a non-technical person (why I needed a CMS at all in the first place) who associates websites with WordPress. She, my wife, is fairly tech savvy, but wouldn‚Äôt accept editing markdown or other ‚Äúcomplicated things‚Äù üôÉ My hypothesis was that I could somewhat compensate for unintuitive features with some ‚Äúon-site training‚Äù.</description></item><item><title>Gatsby Source Plugin for Twitter</title><link>https://www.henriksommerfeld.se/gatsby-source-plugin-for-twitter/</link><pubDate>Thu, 31 Oct 2019 00:20:10 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://www.henriksommerfeld.se/gatsby-source-plugin-for-twitter/</guid><description>I was rewriting a WordPress site in Gatsby that had embedded tweets using an embed script (WordPress plugin). The product owner (my wife), required the new site to also show her tweets. I didn‚Äôt like the idea of an embed script (that would slow down the site and spy on visitors), so I started to look into Gatsby source plugins.</description></item><item><title>Error Handling with Fetch (and custom React hook)</title><link>https://www.henriksommerfeld.se/error-handling-with-fetch/</link><pubDate>Tue, 19 Mar 2019 21:35:58 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://www.henriksommerfeld.se/error-handling-with-fetch/</guid><description>One thing that has struck me with Javascript&amp;rsquo;s fetch function is that it often looks so simple. When I see the same thing in a pull request, I&amp;rsquo;m not overly impressed. No, just because this works on a sunny day doesn&amp;rsquo;t mean you&amp;rsquo;re done. You need error handling as well!</description></item></channel></rss>
