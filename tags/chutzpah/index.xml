Problem When all tests pass with the Chutzpah test runner everything is fine, but when you need to debug a test, things haven&amp;rsquo;t been as easy. Debugging the JS code in Visual Studio is something I never got working and never really cared about anyway. The best debugging tool for JavaScript is of course the web browser, but when selecting Open in browser in Visual Studio, Chutzpah has served the HTML test page (Jasmine in my case) through the FILE:/// protocol.</description></item></channel></rss>
