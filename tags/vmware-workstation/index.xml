Today I discovered a thing that could be made easier however. I&amp;rsquo;m mainly writing this for my own reference, if I stumble on the same thing sometime in the future, perhaps someone else does to.
I copied a group of virtual machines to a new disk and when I migrated them from an earlier version (7) I must have made some error, because the reference to the AD machine was still referring to the old disk.</description></item></channel></rss>
